This program is a speed typing game, where you must type out the
given prompt as fast and as accurate as you can. Since scheme is not
built to handle user interactions to the extent of other programs, there 
are some small caviets. First, the user must put their answer in quotations
or the program would not run properly. Secondly, scheme does not have a 
discrete way to record time, and therefore I was unable to time the users
typing speed. Other than that, the user will type out the prompt in a timely manner
and the program will check for errors and return an accuracy rating.
