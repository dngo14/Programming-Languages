For the miniproject, I have decided to make a speed typing program.
This program would display a text for the user to copy and once entered,
the program would return their speed, accuract and wpm.
In addition to this, the program would display random texts to copy
to keep the user more interested. If I have time, I would add a leaderboard
that would display the fastest time for whatever text that was copied and add
practice game where words would be randomly displayed and the user copies the words
displayed. Another addition to the program would make it so the user has a timelimit
and they must type as many words as possible. Some tests that I would run is to have make sure the program accurately
records when the user starts typing. In addition to this, make sure that calculations for
the results is correct. Another test would to check that the program accuratly records
what the user types. Some other tests, include making sure that the program display different
texts so that the program would not be bland and making sure that the program
can record symbols and other non-alphabetical values.
